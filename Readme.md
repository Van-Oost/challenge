# List Challenge

A list that can be edited without refreshing the page.

*   Items on the list can be re-arrenged using a drag and drop functionality.

*   Counter on top of the page shows how many items are being displayed.

* 	Each item has the actions: edit and delete. Edit allows a user to update the image of an item and the description        text. Delete allows a user to remove an item from the list and update the counter.

*   The user can add a new item to the list. This functionality consist on a form to upload an image (jpg, gif and png       extensions of 320px x 320px size) and a description text (max chars 300).

*   All the actions of the application are done without refreshing the page (sort, add, edit and delete) and saved           immediately.

*   On a page refresh action the last state of the list is displayed.
